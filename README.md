## node-native-http

A very easy example to show how to use the Node native http module to create a server. For post on my blog [Using the Native Node http Module to Start a Node Server, When and Why](http://shiya.io/using-the-native-node-http-module-to-start-a-node-server-when-and-why/).

# Setup

Only need Node.js installed

# Run

```
node index.js
```

Go to localhost:3000, localhost:3000/test to try it out.
